      Using the 3D development platform Unity, my group set out to create an interactive immersive experience.\r
      Our unique world let players explore a UFO abduction using Wii motion controls.\r
    `,process:`\r
      After brainstorming our idea, we began by sketching out our framework. Once we were satisfied, we began\r
      modelling and gathering assets for our project. As we were constructing our game world, we did multiple\r
      user tests to make sure the experience was fun and bug-free.\r
    `,result:`\r
      Our project was featured in a class showcase at SFU's Surrey Campus and received a mark of 24/25.!!!\r
