      ScrollBinder is a character planner app for the popular table-top game, Dungeons and Dragons.\r
      Created as part of a mobile design course, we were given the task of creating a web app that also\r
      utilized web services. ScrollBinder uses Google's Realtime API to enable collaboration between players.\r
    `,process:`\r
      Initially, I had to decide which framwork to use. I settled upon Angular JS, and decided to make an app which\r
      followed Google's Material Design Specs. The first phase of development consisted of creating a working app\r
      that could track player stats and traits. The second phase included adding Google's Realtime API to allow groups\r
      of players to keep track of important adventure details.\r
    `,result:`\r
      ScrollBinder successfully reimagined the DnD experience by bringing. The responsive design\r
      allows it to work on any device, which greatly improves accessibility. I shared this app\r
      with my personal DnD group, and they continue to give me positive reviews and constructive feedback.\r
