      This individual assignment challenged my abilities as a media artist. Using the\r
      song Harvey the Wonder Hamster by Weird Al Yankovic as the base concept, I brainstormed,\r
      storyboarded, and edited until I was happy with the final outcome.\r
    `,process:`\r
      This assignment began with brainstorming and storyboarding the rough concept. This concept\r
      was submitted for feedback, which I included in the final video. I had to book rooms, rent\r
      equiment/instruments, and edit the film. Once I had all my footage, I used Primiere Pro and\r
      Adobe After Effects to add a funky visualizer effect and key out the green screen.\r
    `,result:`\r
      When it was finished, Harvey The Wonder Hamster was shown to the class and received a mark of 23/25.\r
